To handle 2D images, we reshape the image $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times W \\times C}$ into a sequence of flattened 2D patches $\\mathbf{x}_p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times\\left(P^2 \\cdot C\\right)}$, where ( $H, W$ ) is the resolution of the original image, $C$ is the number of channels, $(P, P)$ is the resolution of each image patch, and $N=H W / P^2$ is the resulting number of patches, which also serves as the effective input sequence length for the Transformer. The Transformer uses constant latent vector size $D$ through all of its layers, so we flatten the patches and map to $D$ dimensions with a trainable linear projection (Eq. 1). We refer to the output of this projection as the patch embeddings.\n",
