# Pytorch Learning Repository

Welcome to my Pytorch learning repository! Here, I document my progress with various notebooks and projects that highlight Pytorchâ€™s capabilities and explore its fundamentals in machine learning and deep learning.

The repository is organized into sections:

Fundamental Concepts: A series of Jupyter notebooks focused on learning and mastering the foundational elements of TensorFlow. Applied Projects: Practical projects showcasing my application of TensorFlow to solve diverse challenges and real-world problems. This repository is a work in progress. I'll update the README and content as I continue on this journey.

### Fundamental Concepts (in progress): 
- Pytorch fundamentals:
  * Create torch tensors and show properties like `item()` or `dim.`
  * Create random torch tensors using `torch.rand(rows, cols)`
  * Create zeroes and one's tensors.
  * Create tensor ranges, and investigate the different tensor datatypes.
  * Getting tensor attributes: `dtype`, `shape`, `device`.
  * Tensors with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, matrix multiplication.
