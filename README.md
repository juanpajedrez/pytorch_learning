# Pytorch Learning Repository

Welcome to my Pytorch learning repository! Here, I document my progress with notebooks and projects highlighting Pytorchâ€™s capabilities and exploring its fundamentals in machine learning and deep learning.

The repository is organized into sections:

Fundamental Concepts: A series of Jupyter notebooks focused on learning and mastering the foundational elements of TensorFlow. Applied Projects: Practical projects showcasing my application of TensorFlow to solve diverse challenges and real-world problems. This repository is a work in progress. I'll update the README and content as I continue on this journey.

### Fundamental Concepts (in progress): 
- Pytorch fundamentals:
  * Create torch tensors and show properties like `item()` or `dim.`
  * Create random torch tensors using `torch.rand(rows, cols)`
  * Create zeroes and one's tensors.
  * Create tensor ranges, and investigate the different tensor datatypes.
  * Getting tensor attributes: `dtype`, `shape`, `device`.
  * Tensors with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, matrix multiplication.
  * Proper matrix multiplication with proper inner shapes.
  * tensor aggregation for `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`, `mean()`.
  * Reshaping, stacking, squeezing, unsqueezing, and permute methods applications.
  * Indexing 2D, 3D, and ND torch tensors.
  * Cast torch and numpy tensors using `torch.from_numpy(ndarray)`, and `torch.Tensor.numpy()`.
  * Cast between PyTorch and NumPy.
  * PyTorch reproducibility using `torch.manual_seed(RANDOM_SEED)`
